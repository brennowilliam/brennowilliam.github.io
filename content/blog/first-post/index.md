This is my first post on my new blog!

I'm hoping that with this blog, I can share things as I learn to help others learn as well.

I'll talk about everything that I learn. From coding to fitness stuff, I want to give people
the chance to see how I do things.

Also, I plan to learn a lot from others who can share their knowledge with me as well.

As a first post with programming content, I plan on writing about my learning experience with Elm.
I've been learning Elm since last week, and I am finding it to be fascinated.

So, stay tuned for my next post!

See you next post!
